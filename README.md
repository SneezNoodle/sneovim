# Sneovim
My silly little neovim config that I spend way too much time working on. It is most likely messy in code, structure and commit history, but I'm learning (slowly). For example, much later, this readme file might be half decent.

## Directory structure
- core: basic editor settings, loaded before plugins.
- plugins: plugin specs for Lazy.nvim.
- lsp-settings: lspconfig setup tables, with files named after their respective servers.
- utils: miscellaneous modules for either repeated tasks or chunks of code that make other files look ugly. Currently mostly unused.

A lot of this will hopefully become cleaner over time.
